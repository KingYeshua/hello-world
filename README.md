# hello-world
Time capsule message for future self.

I don't think I should pursue a job in programming. I should create things that I enjoy. I have been learning for over a year now. The date is 01/25/2021. Still in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Right now I am in Goodyear, Arizone. In a few days I will be boarding a plane with my son and girlfriend. We are going to Kansas City where I will get a local CDL job. Then i will buy a new car and travel around America once again, driving for Uber and lyft. Camping will be fun. I will continue learning programming.
